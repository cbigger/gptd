# **gptd**
A systemd daemonization of the cli implementation of https://github.com/minimaxir/simpleaichat and the openai API. 
The current alpha gptd runs a tcp/ip server which forwards all incoming data to a single continuous ChatGPT conversation, providing a shared context for system software. Can be further configured with any OpenAI API available models (default: gpt-3.5-turb).

This project includes the Python script(s) required for the continuous chat TCP/IP server, a systemd service file for running the service as a daemon on Debian-based Linux systems, and a .deb.

You can run the python script directly in a terminal for debugging client interactions. STDERR is logged via python.
